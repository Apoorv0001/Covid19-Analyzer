            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic in India is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 
              caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of COVID-19 
              in India, which originated from China, was reported on 30 January 2020.
              In July 2020, India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said that the country's case fatality 
              rate was among the lowest in the world at 2.41% and was "steadily declining".By mid-May 2020, eight 
              cities accounted for around half of all reported cases in the country: Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, 
              Chennai, Pune, and Kolkata.The last region to report its first case was Lakshadweep, on 19 January 2021, 
              nearly a year after the first reported case in India.

              each and every citizen of the country and effecting the growth of the country as well as because due to lack 
              of proper attention and precaution cases are rising each and every at a drastic rate and due to that the 
              public and private sectors are being effected severly.From the figures on the right you can visualize what is

            <p>Age is one of the factors that are used to branch the spread of this pandemic. 
            India is a vast country with a geographic area of 3,287,240 square kilometers and a total 
            population of about 1.3 billion. Most of the Indian states are quite large in geographic 
            area and population. Analyzing coronavirus infection data, considering the entirety of India to 
            be on the same page may not provide us the right picture. This is because the first infection, new 
            infection rate, progression over time, and preventive measures taken by state governments and the 
            common public for each state are different.The Graph on the right displays the agewise distribution
            of confirmed positive cases which are based on the age factor.

            <p>As the scenerio of covid is getting worse dayby day in the country and medical and 
              healthcare personnels are keeping tracks of the age range of patients that are being affected
              by the covid scenerio as it is suspectable through analysis that the people age is one 
              of the key factors of the current scenrio and the number of cases that are being reported
              day by day are showing that the age groups have different effects of the virus from
              mild to life concerning stages all are curled around the age factor as the human immune
              system is also affected due to age.</p>

            <p>After Analysing the data for the individuals that are effected by the covid 19 scenerio
                that is going in each every nation and effecting the health of the people drastically.
                First, age-varying susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV-2, where children are less 
                susceptible than adults to becoming infected on contact with an infectious person, would 
                reduce cases among children. Decreased susceptibility could result from immune 
                cross-protection from other coronaviruses.
                Second, children could experience mild or no symptoms on infection more frequently than 
                adults. Clinical cases result from infections that cause noticeable symptoms, such that 
                the person may seek clinical care. An infection that does not result in a clinical case 
                may be truly asymptomatic, or may be paucisymptomaticâ€”that is, resulting in mild symptoms 
                that may not be noticed or reported even though they occur.

            <br>
            <p>Age-dependent variation in severity has been observed for other respiratory virus infections, 
               including SARS.For COVID-19, there are strong indications of age dependence in severity and 
               mortality among those cases that are reported, which could extend more generally to age-dependent 
               severity and likelihood of clinically reportable symptoms upon infection.
               Third, differences in contact patterns among individuals of different ages, and setting-specific
                differences in age distribution, themselves affect the expected number of cases in each age group. 
                Children tend to make more social contacts than adults and hence, all else being equal, should 
                contribute more to transmission than adults.

            <p>As the virus is showing different severity ranges for different age groups so it is
              also affecting the recovery rate of the patients. Age factor is becoming an imminent
              criteria that is effecting the recovery of the patients.Recovery rate of patients are 
              varying based on age groups and this is factor that needs to be considered by the 
              authorities while deciding the methods to control the situation in hand.

            <p>The death toll after the recovery from covid from various age groups is also varying
              depending on the ages because after the recovery from the virus the bodies immune system
              is rendered weak and the bodies resistance power is also decreased and taken in consideration
              the age groups in the range 50 - 80 are considered as a age range where the body is not fully
              strong as it is in adults in the age of below 50.The figure on the left will be giving you a 
              clearer view on the fact.
